# Flight Action API

Define easily configurable commands that can be preformed over a single or group of nodes.

## Installation

### Preconditions

The following are required to run this application:

* OS:           Centos7
* Ruby:         2.5+
* Yum Packages: gcc, make

### Manual installation

Start by cloning the repo, adding the binaries to your path, and install the gems. This guide assumes the `bin` directory is on your `PATH`. If you prefer not to modify your `PATH`, then some of the commands need to be prefixed with `/path/to/app/bin`.

```
git clone https://github.com/openflighthpc/flight-action-api
cd flight-action-api

# Add the binaries to your path, which will be used by the remainder of this guide
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/bin
bundle install --without development test --path vendor

# The following command can be ran without modifying the PATH variable by
# prefixing `bin/` to the commands
bin/bundle install --without development test pry --path vendor
```

### Configuration

Please refer to the [configuration file](etc/action-api.yaml).

#### Commands Config

The `commands` are configured by creating sub directories of the `command_directory_path` directory.  A valid command directory contains a `metadata.yaml` file and an executable `default.sh` script.

A sample command is provided in this repository:

```
$ ls libexec-dev/sample
default.sh  metadata.yaml  metal.sh
$ cat libexec-dev/sample/metadata.yaml
help:
  summary: 'sample action'
  description: >
    A sample action to serve as a simple example of how to create commands and
    scripts.
$ cat libexec-dev/sample/default.sh 
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running the default script for: $name"
echo Done
$ cat libexec-dev/sample/metal.sh 
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running the metal script for: $name"
echo Doing metal stuff ....
echo Done
```

The `help` section in metadata.yaml is required as it is used by client-side to generate help pages. The required `summary` should be a single line summary of the command, where the optional description maybe longer.

In additional to the `default.sh` script, other scripts can optionally be defined for other ranks.  The script selected for executation is based on the available scripts and the ranks for the current node.

#### Standalone Nodes

The `nodes` are read from a static YAML file with the following structure. See the [example nodes config](etc/nodes.example.yaml) for the version which is used when running in the `development` environment.

```
<node-name>:
  ranks: [rank1, rank2, ...]
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
  ....
...
```

The `ranks` key is optional and maybe either a single string or an array of them. This alters the `script` lookup order against the `command` according to the `ranks` mechanism.

All other keys are considered `parameters` to the `node` and are available to the `variables` mechanism.

### Integrating with systemd and OpenFlightHPC/FlightRunway

The [provided systemd unit file](support/flight-action-api.service) has been designed to integrate with the `OpenFlightHPC` [flight-runway](https://github.com/openflighthpc/flight-runway) package. The following preconditions must be satisfied for the unit file to work:
1. `OpenFlightHPC` `flight-runway` must be installed,
2. The server must be installed within `/opt/flight/opt/flight-action-api`,
3. The log directory must exist: `/opt/flight/var/log`, and
4. The configuration file must exist: `/opt/flight/etc/flight-action-api.conf`.

The configuration file will be loaded into the environment by `systemd` and can be used to override values within `config/application.yaml`. This is the recommended way to set the custom configuration values and provides the following benefits:
1. The config will be preserved on update,
2. It keeps the secret keys separate from the code base, and
3. It eliminates the need to source a `bashrc` in order to setup the environment.

## Starting the Server

The `puma` server daemon can be started manually with:

```
bin/puma -p <port> -e production -d \
          --redirect-append \
          --redirect-stdout <stdout-log-file-path> \
          --redirect-stderr <stderr-log-file-path> \
          --pidfile         <pid-file-path>
```

## Stopping the Server

The `pumactl` command can be used to preform various start/stop/restart actions on the puma server. Assuming that `systemd` hasn't been setup, the following will stop the server:

```
bin/pumactl stop
```

## Authentication

The API requires all requests to carry with a [jwt](https://jwt.io). All tokens have permission to view and execute the `commands`.

The following `rake` tasks are used to generate tokens with 30 days expiry. Tokens from other sources will be accepted as long as they:
1. Where signed with the same shared secret,
2. An [expiry claim](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4) has been made.

As the shared secret is environment dependant, the `RACK_ENV` must be set within your environment.

```
# Set the rack environment
export RACK_ENV=production

# Generate a user token
rake token:user       # Valid for 30 days [Default]
rake token:user[360]  # Valid for 360 days
```
